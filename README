This project is open source, it may be used in whatever way you want it to, though it really only has one purpose: to install and update iMod. iMod is a theme + software package for iPhone OS 5.1.1 (and iOS 6 eventually). You will notice many changes to the operating system once installed (like a status bar tweak and some new apps). To build:

run "git clone http://github.com/phyrrus9/iMod-Installer"
this will clone the latest branch to your computer. next, enter its directory
run "cd ./iMod-Installer"
now, to build correctly you need to be using a mac with OS X 10.7.4 or OSX 10.8 DP 4, just
run "sudo make"
this will leave the imodinstaller.deb in the directory. I then proceed to upload it to the source.

To change version numbers on the package,
run "nano ./imodinstaller/DEBIAN/control"
